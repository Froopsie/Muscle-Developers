4.	We are going to create a checklist/calory counter app. We will allow the user to input what food they had for breakfast or lunch or dinner and input the calories the food contained.
   We will add up the total calories and display it. We will show a calory goal and how close they are to it. We will also allow users to create a checklist of exercises so they can stay on top of themselves.

6.	We are going to create a shell of the app and organize how it will look so we may understand how it will be implemented.
